# portfolio-optimization-py
This Python project utilizes Sharpe Ratio, Kelly Criterion, CVaR, and Risk Parity to aid investors in risk-return balancing. It provides visualizations such as backtesting with a $100,000 initial investment, efficient frontier analysis with optimal portfolio markers, and a correlation heatmap for data-driven asset allocation.
